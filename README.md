The recently released spotify wrapped has inspired me to look into datasets surrounding music. For those unaware, spotify wrapped is an end of the year data dump that spotify comes out with every year. It summarizes time listened, favorite artists, favorite songs, and much more. This year I listened to around 230,000 minutes worth of music so I wanted to see other peoples listening habits. Going into this, I was curious about the least popular and the most popular statistics amoung listeners.
